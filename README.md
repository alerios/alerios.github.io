# alerios.github.io — Jekyll (minima)

This repository is being migrated to a GitHub Pages site built with Jekyll and the `minima` theme.

Local development:
- Install Ruby and Bundler (e.g., `gem install bundler`)
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` and visit `http://localhost:4000`

Notes:
- Posts have been migrated into `_posts/`.
- Static assets are under `img/`, `css/`, `js/` and will be served as-is.
- The `pages-setup` branch contains the migration work — I'll open a PR to merge into `main` once we've verified the build.
