title: MiniDebconf at Panama (day Three)
---

Today is the last day of this conference, which has been a great experience of
interaction between Central America and Caribbean communities. Yesterday we
had packaging, BTS, kernel, pbuilder and quilt related talks. We also expanded
the web of trust with a key signing party with almost 30 participants. Even a
BoF about people interested in VoIP was held before going downtown to share
some beers :)

This morning we had talks about hands on maintaining and translation tasks, we
had also a group photo, and a quick visit to the Panama Canal.

Although it has been hard for me to and others to identify common areas of
interest towards future work in Debian, it seems to me that these could be
centered around l10n and i18n issues, along with packaging and digital
inclusion projects.
