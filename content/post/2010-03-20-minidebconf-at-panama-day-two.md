title: MiniDebconf at Panama (day Two)
---

Yesterday began the central america and caribbean MiniDebconf at Panama. Over
50 people from Mexico, Belice, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Salvador,
Colombia and Venezuela, among others, are here to share experiences around
Free Software and Debian contributions. All this is possible to several
sponsors from Panama and SPI, and the hard work from many people, specially
Anto Recio, Mauro Rosero, Carolina Flores, Gunnar Wolf and the local team.

More info(in spanish), including live streaming url can be found on:

update: Also, on a personal note, I'll take the chance of this event to start
my transition to a stronger gpg key, so If you have signed my old one, please
take a look at: http://people.debian.org/~alerios/key-transition-2010-03-20.txt
