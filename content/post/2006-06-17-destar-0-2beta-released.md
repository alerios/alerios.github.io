title: Â¡Destar 0.2beta released!
---

Yes, it's true. Almost 6 months have passed since the last release and we have
worked a lot to improve [Destar](http://destar.berlios.de/) and make it more
stable and useful.

Basically, this beta release contains:

- A new interface style.
- Referencial integrity.
- Better i18n support.
- Better statistics for CDR.
- Use of some [asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) 1.2.X new features.

- Many new features.
- Several Bug fixes.

We hope you can enjoy testing it and helping us release the 0.2 version.

And file the bugs you find on:

Greetings, and thanks for using Destar :)
