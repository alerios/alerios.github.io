title: Linux guy working in a Windows desktop

After >7 years of working on my own Linux machine, I now have to work on a
Windows XP laptop for my new employer.

It's been almost a week and a half now, and I think I'm starting to get used
to it (as far as a Gnome user can be), thanks to the following tools, that I
had to install in order to survive and not getting mad:

- [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox): for obvious reasons, the first thing is to get rid of IE.

- [gVim](http://www.vim.org/): thank $DEITY there is a windows port for Vim.![Enlace](http://alerios-en.blogspot.com/img/blank.gif)

- [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html): of course, I still need to log into several Linux machines.

- [mRemote](http://www.mremote.org/): its a wrapper around putty to handle several sessions, and also supports RDP and other protocols.

- [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/): just because mRemote doesn't support SCP.

- [muCommander](http://www.mucommander.com/): to browse the file system in a decent way. It also supports SCP, but I haven't been able to customize it properly (opening files with gVim), so I'm not using it really.

- [XChat](http://xchat.org/): its always cool to hang around IRC.

- [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/): to deal with the social mess of chats/contacts out there.

There is also a [GEdit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) for windows, but I
seldom use it.
