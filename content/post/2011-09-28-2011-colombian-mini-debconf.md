title: 2011 Colombian Mini-DebConf
---

This weekend we'll be having the 4th version of the Colombian Mini-Debconf. It
will be held in the [Otraparte Museum](http://www.otraparte.org/casa-museo/otraparte.html), in the city of Medellin. The cool thing this year is
that we'll be having mostly Debian contributors than just users, with the kind
participation of [Anibal Monsalve](http://www.v7w.com/anibal/), who is
currently in the country.

There will be several 10-min lightening talks, followed by a key signing party
and some actual work in packaging, and of course we'll be having some beers
with Debian friends.
