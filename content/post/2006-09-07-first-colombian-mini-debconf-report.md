title: First Colombian Mini-DebConf Report
---

`As announced on [1], we had the first Colombian Mini-DebConf[2] at`  
 `August 19th and 20th 2.006.`

`14 Debian enthusiasts from all over the country joined the event, and we`  
`even got the help from Luciano Bello from Argentina, who was invited to`  
`the related event "Jornadas de Software Libre" [3] that was held in`  
`parallel. `

`Colombian Debian community is just starting to get into the work and we`  
`couldn't manage to do any BSP, but we did an on-hands workshop on`  
`general Debian tasks and package maintainance. At the end, we also had a`  
`KSP, organized by Santiago Ruano Rincon[4]. At least 4 of the 14`  
`assistants have continued the work that was started that day.`

`Santiago was the only DD present, and only Luciano and I have had any`  
`previous and continued experience at the NMP, so the three of us made`  
`the talking and helped the assistants on their work. `

`A more detailed report can be found in Spanish at [5].`
